- cache by app-relative paths, not just filenames ;o
- when a change is detected, rebuild everything that uses the changed module
- associate obj files with components

+ unloading
+ cache source file dependencies to avoid scanning them all the time
+ loading of .obj and .lib files thru DDL
+ dependency finding of .d files
+ extract all deps from the main program
	// module info
+ compiling .d files into sets of obj's
	+ don't compile obj's included in the source app
		this may cause some symbols to be unresolved ( the dm linker may
		remove some symbols from the executable )
		but nothing is lost, the missing symbols can be taken from
		the 'misc' component source. get them.
	+ cache the .obj files in some directory
+ gathering of required .obj files to link an app
+ basic linking
+ config parsing
+ linking according to the 'resolve order'
+ make 'self' refs local to lib types
